Packages Downloads and Installables
===================================

Any and all packages that need to be installed for this repository to work
should be specified here in the, ``repo_packages`` directory. The files in 
this directory are given to plays as additional options.  The options have 
several default actions which are all processed by the following roles:
**package_source_archive**, **package_source_install**, 
**package_system_install**. Inside these files all download-able objects
such as tar-balls and random files should also be specified. While the packaging
roles may not be used to process these links the stated purpose of this 
directory is to have anything that is "installable" in a single location with
the goal to allow for easily manipulation of requirements as they change.

Defaults processed by the **package_source_archive**, 
**package_source_install**, **package_system_install** roles:
